Array Length calculation = arr.length

Arrays works on Pass by reference
Pass by value : The change in value of the variable inside the function does not reflected in function calling or main function
Pass by reference : The change in value of the variable inside the function is also reflected in function calling or inside the main function

The Lagest possible Integer value : Integer.MAX_VALUE      (- infinity)
The Smallest possible Integer value : Integer.MIN_VALUE    (+ infinity)

If there are n elements in an array then the total number of pairs in the array is ( n(n-1) ) / 2
Numbers of Sub-arrays in an array is : ( n(n+1) ) / 2
Time Complexity of Binary Search is : O(log n)
Time Complexity of Linear Search is : O(n)
Time Complexity of reversing array by Swapping is : O(n) 
Space Complexity of reversing array by Swapping is : O(1) constant
